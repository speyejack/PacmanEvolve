NEAT - Neural Evolution through Augmenting Topologies

2.1.4 NEAT uses direct encoding

2.2-END- Talks about historical origin, and how this is natures way of preventing the competing conventions problem and loss of crucial data

2.3- Talks about speciation(niching), (species)
Node added to geneome w/o connection...
genes = nodes? or links? - They're both, node gene and link gene
species = group of simliar geonomes
generation = group of species
geonome = configuration, (data structure) = Genotype
network = network (visualiation) = Phenotype - doesn't include disabled genes
Use explicit fitness sharing to weed out the worst in the species rather than the worst of population

2.4-Initalization
start minimally
allowed without complication due to speciation


---3---

Inovation number of a gene is top number in each genome
Node gene mentioned at end of figure 3

3.1- Genetic Encoding
Beginning discribes gene characteristics
Node gene: list of inputs, hidden nodes, and outputs
Connection gene: in-node, out-node, weight, enabled
3 types of mutations: weighted mutation, adding connection (between two unconnected), adding node (existing connection is split, new connection weight between prev and cur = 1, new connect between cur & next = old connect weight)

3.2 - Tracking genes through historical markings (innovation number)
Innovation number is talked about in 2nd para. Global num that whenever a mutation occurs the new genes are assigned to it
Procedure for breeding at bottom

3.3 - Using species
This explains species
